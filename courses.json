This course will chart the hopes, fears, and aspirations of those who leave- from African perspectives. We'll read a range of fiction and poetry from across the continent, from canonical writers like Chinua Achebe and Tayeb Salih to some of the acclaimed new voices of our century. We'll study literature that imagines new life in the metropolises of Johannesburg and Lagos, as well as more far flung cities like Detroit, London, and Barcelona. We'll ask what distinguishes diaspora from exile, how a former life can follow a person to new places. We'll read about perilous Mediterranean crossings, LGBTQ persecution, undocumented life in America, and children dreaming of distant lands. Our study of migrant literatures will even take us to other worlds, reading Nnedi Okorafor's interstellar science fiction as a speculative extension of the more historically based works"

Forged in the 1780s by black north Atlantic mariners, the solidarity would encompass many areas of life before and during the apartheid era. This course explores four of those areas: evangelical ties connecting African American churches with South Africa\u2019s independent church organizations; the spread of Booker T. Washington\u2019s educational ideals in black South African academic circles; the impact of the Harlem Renaissance on African popular township culture; and the cross-fertilization of political ideologies originating on both sides of the Atlantic: Africans fighting against apartheid learned important lessons from the crusades of anti-colonial activists and internationalists in the diaspora, such as Marcus Garvey, Paul Robeson, and Mahatma Gandhi."

The powerful, multi-part relationships established by this trio of drums provide a rhythmic foundation for the ensemble, enabling djembe players to develop technique in executing both accompaniment and solo parts. Drawing upon his experience as a soloist with the internationally acclaimed groups Les Percussions de Guin\u00e9e and Les Ballets Africains, Fana engages ensemble players with a wide repertory of music from various regions of Guinea, including the rhythms of the Susu, Malinke, and Baga language groups."

As we read Frederick Douglass\u2019s slave narrative, Henry Thoreau\u2019s Walden, Rachel Carson\u2019s Silent Spring, Toni Morrison\u2019s Song of Solomon, Leslie Silko\u2019s Ceremony, and more, we will explore how these creative authors have left us an archive of historical traces that can help us understand our own environmental experiences today. Topics covered include colonialism, ecotourism, slavery, civil rights, trauma, technology, urbanization, the rise of science, and students can expect to explore questions such as, What are the environmental politics of race? How do indigenous writers respond to the trauma of losing homelands? How to communicate the hazards of climate change? How do we create a meaningful connection to home and the planet amidst so much injustice and technological upheaval?"

This course is a study of Black Paris, as imagined by generations of Black cultural producers. Paris is a space of freedom and artistic glory that African American writers, soldiers and artists were denied back home. For students from French colonies, Paris was the birthplace of Negritude, the cultural renaissance informed by the Harlem Renaissance. Black Paris, for those caught in poor suburbs, calls to mind images of riots, dilapidated schools, but also rap music and hip-hop, elements of transnational black imagination that sometimes speaks the language of the Black Lives Matter movement.

Analysts make buy, sell, and hold recommendations based on analysis of financial information; 3) creditors and lenders use financial statement information as input into lending decisions. Lenders use financial information to determine the type, amount and terms of a loan, and also the nature of any covenants, and 4) corporations and investment bankers use financial statements to value companies that might be takeover targets. The primary objective is to develop and sharpen students' analytical ability to analyze financial statements and draw inferences about a firm's performance and future prospects."

Effective tax planning requires the planner to consider the tax implications of a proposed transaction for all of the parties to the transaction. Effective tax planning requires the planner, in making investment and financing decisions, to consider not only explicit taxes (tax dollars paid directly to taxing authorities), but also implicit taxes (taxes paid indirectly in the form of lower before-tax rates of return on tax-favored investments). Effective tax planning requires the planner to recognize that taxes represent only one among many business costs. In the planning process, all costs must be considered, including the costly restructuring of the business necessary to implement some tax plans."

The course also covers the relation between cash flow and accruals and the market pricing of accruals and the components of accruals. The study of accruals naturally leads to research on earnings management that focuses on how and why earnings are managed. Research on how earnings are managed focuses on managers' opportunistic manipulation of accounting accruals and/or via altering real activities while research on the managerial incentives to manage reported earnings focuses on (among other topics) the literature on meeting or beating earnings expectations and earnings thresholds."

For firms, the implications of value-maximization for input demands and output supplies are explored thoroughly. Managerial choices related to multiple products, intertemporal production planning and uncertainty are explicitly modeled. Some extensions to monopoly behavior are considered. Finally, some implications of consumer and competitive firm behavior for industry (single market) and general equilibrium are examined."

In looking at these, we will consider both the approaches that key scholars in the field of media studies use, and the concepts that are central to the field itself (media/medium; medium-specificity; remediation; the culture industry; reification and utopia; cultural politics).

After developing a core vocabulary for thinking about comics as a medium we will then look at how artists and directors have drawn on that vocabulary in a range of different contexts. Retaining a sense of the specificity of both comics and film as artistic mediums, we will closely consider topics ranging from cross-cultural translation, ontologies of otherness, and modes of mediated history.

      "description": "What is a copy? The question may seem trivial and the answer obvious, yet just what do we mean when we say a work is a copy? Is a copy the same thing as a reproduction, replication, repetition, imitation, duplicate, or facsimile? And what of related terms such as fake, forgery or counterfeit? Throughout history artists have addressed the work of others, and sometimes their own work, from the point of view of imitating it, appropriating it, and refashioning it. As a practice copying in its many forms has underpinned the production of art since earliest times. As a theory imitation precedes notions of authenticity and originality, and may be said to bring these latter concepts into being. This course will examine copying across the full range visual media \u2013 painting, sculpture, architecture, printmaking photography, film and new media."

The class will allow for general discussion of the history of photography with some detailed discussion of particular photographers, images, & texts. The class will look at photography as a cultural phenomenon as much as an art form, critically studying the various discursive arenas that this new medium helped to foster and redefine. We will also ask what makes photographic images so compelling, what we expect to see in them & what, distinguishes in the photographic realm a document from an artwork, & an ephemeral image from a material object."

Furthermore, when we look at early Renaissance paintings we do not see them through the eyes of the people who produced them or for whom they were produced. We have to learn to see them as they might have been seen. We can begin to do this by learning how to read and to interpret the complex elements at play beneath the immediate surface by setting the artist, his work, and his public in their social and religious historical contexts, and by exploring the universal unspoken language of signs and symbols used by artists. The course content is based on painted forms, i.e., panels, canvases, and frescos from the Trecento and Quattrocento with an emphasis on Tuscan painting. The selection, as far as possible, takes advantage of the availability of works in churches, museums, and galleries within easy visiting distance of Arezzo."

From the hard-edged paintings of Neo-Classicism that came of age during the French Revolution, to the abstractions of Constructivism that gave form to the Bolshevik cause in Russia, the admixture of radical politics and avant-garde aesthetics has always defined the emergence of modern art. What, then, is the relationship between politics and art, particularly during dramatic events of social and political upheaval? How does radical art correspond to radical politics, and what are the limits of each? What role does violence play in the production of revolutionary images? With these questions in mind, students will learn how the study of art can illuminate how these past revolts, rebellions, and insurrections that happened across Europe and its colonial territories continue to shape geopolitics today."

Since its invention, the photographic image has framed and reframed the fluid concept of the self through various artistic, social, technological, and conceptual practices. Engaging philosophy, art history, and photography theory, this course examines how photography has been used to give shape to various philosophies of the self, from the theory of autonomy put forward by philosophers of the Enlightenment to that of identity mediated by social discourse as proposed by contemporary critical theorists. Together, we will examine various episodes from the history of photography, from explorations of Romantic subjectivity in the nineteenth century, to examinations of the \u201cselfie\u201d as a form of public spectacle in culture today."

Throughout history artists have addressed the work of others, and sometimes their own work, from the point of view of imitating it, appropriating it, and refashioning it. As a practice copying in its many forms has underpinned the production of art since earliest times. As a theory imitation precedes notions of authenticity and originality, and may be said to bring these latter concepts into being.

What, then, is the relationship between politics and art, particularly during dramatic events of social and political upheaval? How does radical art correspond to radical politics, and what are the limits of each? What role does violence play in the production of revolutionary images?

Since its invention, the photographic image has framed and reframed the fluid concept of the self through various artistic, social, technological, and conceptual practices. Engaging philosophy, art history, and photography theory, this course examines how photography has been used to give shape to various philosophies of the self, from the theory of autonomy put forward by philosophers of the Enlightenment to that of identity mediated by social discourse as proposed by contemporary critical theorists. Together, we will examine various episodes from the history of photography, from explorations of Romantic subjectivity in the nineteenth century, to examinations of the \u201cselfie\u201d as a form of public spectacle in culture today."

Among the topics for consideration are Holocaust memorials, Native American and Polynesian museums and cultural centers, African American quilt histories, and even individual artists\u2019 projects of the last few decades (Judy Chicago, Fred Wilson, Silvia Gruner, Jos\u00e9 Bedia, and Jolene Rickard, among others). Readings will be drawn principally from the disciplines of history, anthropology, cultural studies, and art criticism."

Faust is a high-level functional programming language designed for real-time digital signal processing (DSP), sound synthesis, and sound analysis. The Faust compiler can translate the same source code into other programming languages and export to audio applications or plug-ins running on various platforms, including Windows, MacOS, and Linux, iOS, and Android. JUCE is a cross-platform C++ application framework used to design audio applications, audio plug-ins, animated applications, and OpenGL applications. Many professional audio applications and plug-ins have been built with JUCE, mainly used for its GUI, plug-in, and DSP libraries. At the end of the semester, we will have an Audio Software Show demonstrating the audio applications or plug-ins designed by the students."

How are they adapting to life in a land whose language, customs, rules, and expectations may be initially foreign to them? How are the long-term residents of that land responding to their presence and challenges? Pursuing these and related questions, this course offers an introduction to refugee experiences in the United States.

The course focuses on developing skills in the areas of linguistic data analysis and interpretation of linguistic data in ways that aim to address theoretical and empirical issues in the study of language. In addition to the lecture students will need to register for a peer-led workshop."

Second, it will introduce students to the vast cultural diversity of New Guinea and its neighboring islands and to how this region (Melanesia) has played a central role in the history of anthropological theory and method. The course is thus a general inquiry into the practice of ethnography, including fieldwork and writing, carried out through a close reading of materials from one particular area of the world.

Readings focus on the specific historical, legal, and structural features of the corporation. Topics for discussion include: the corporate form; corporate personhood; corporate branding and response to criticism; the ideology of shareholder value; shareholder activism and corporate social responsibility. Students will propose, develop and present a semester-long research project that focuses on one particular corporation.

Homes evoke powerful emotions about place and highlight the dynamic and complex nature of people, their relationships to each other, and the broader society they live in. Archaeologists, therefore, must study the material culture found in and around domestic dwellings to identify any reoccurring patterns of those materials to reconstruct household practices and social relations. This course focuses on the ways that material traces from the past shed light on the diversity of domestic life, which includes household organization; economic strategies; the diet and status of households; ritual practice, and identity. To this end, we will read case studies from household archaeology about all types of homes (mobile shelters to palaces), but also review important texts that discuss domestic space, the family, and the organization of domestic labor. Students should expect this to be a reading intensive class with heavy emphasis on participation"

In this course we will delve into the cognitive processes underlying writing and reading: how writers generate ideas, translate those ideas into words and sentences, organize those sentences into arguments, and do all of this while managing things like spelling and typing, and how readers actually interpret the message being conveyed by a piece of writing. We\u2019ll also explore the extent to which research in cognitive science can inform what we do as writers by experimenting on ourselves with research-grounded strategies. Students will read and take responsibility for presenting work from cognitive scientists and composition theorists, and will work towards a final project in which they explore existing research on a topic of their choosing and propose either further research or applications of that research."

Thematic topics will include: structural and functional diversity among sensory neuronal populations, common themes across sensory systems such as parallel information processing, coordination among feedforward/feedback circuits, and neuronal plasticity during development of functional domains. The final course module will focus on exploring the neuronal mechanisms of attention, again from a neuron- and circuit-centric perspective. Multiple sensory systems will be discussed with primary emphasis on the visual system as a model for understanding structure/function relationships. The course will also introduce students to modern methodological approaches in systems neuroscience. A major goal of the course is to familiarize students with reading and critiquing primary research literature through weekly readings, small group discussions, and short written summaries of scientific papers."

This course differs from BIO 111 in that there is a greater emphasis on mathematical modeling of biological processes. Note that both BIO 111 and BIO 113 are designed for students who intend to major in biology. Open only to first-year students or by permission of instructor. The course includes three lectures and one recitation per week and a bi-weekly laboratory. Regarding registering for labs, students will receive an email from the Undergrad Biology Dept. with a link to enroll online. This will give equal opportunity for all registered to select time slots based on a \"first come first serve\" basis. The link will be sent via email on Friday, November 8th at 9:00AM."

You will design your own experiments, construct new genetic parts, and validate the constructs using new characterization assays. In addition to the wet-lab research, iGEM involves mathematical modeling to predict the behavior and guide the design of the new biological parts and characterization assays. Students also design, construct, characterize, and improve their own piece of hardware that will work together with the designed biological organism. The policy and practice component addresses the social, legal, and ethical issues of the project. iGEM is multi-disciplinary, highly collaborative, and student-managed. You will travel to Boston and interact with 300 universities from all over the world."

      "description": "How does Black Paris, as the lived experience of today marginalized immigrants, as a site of the production of a certain understanding of blackness, contribute to our understanding of the global black condition? Within a French context, how does the historical representation of blackness, from slavery to the contemporary moment by way of colonization, inform the current black experience? Paris represented a space of freedom and artistic glory that African American writers, soldiers and artists were denied back home. However, for those caught in poor suburbs, calls to mind images of riots, dilapidated schools, the Black America has come to embody the new land of hope. Rap music and hip-hop, elements of transnational black imagination that sometimes speaks the language of the Black Lives Matter movement, are the soundtrack of this new Black Paris. This course captures, through readings and film enhanced with a visit of Black Paris, the promise and the challenges of Black Paris."

In this course, we will examine the relationship between traumatic memory and the construction or rehabilitation of meaning in various works of literature starting from shortly after the death of Mao and the end of the Cultural Revolution and reaching into the twenty-first century. In particular, we will begin with works of the \u201cScar\u201d and \u201cRoot-seeking\u201d genres from the 1970s and 1980s; in later weeks, we will analyze works from the 1990s and beyond that envisioned a range of post-socialist futures for a China that still bore (and bears) the weight of traumatic memory.

They will acquire practical skills in the routine use of radiation detectors, monitors, and electronics, and develop the ability to assess radiation threats and prospects of their abatement. The four in-depth ANSEL experiments are designed to help recreate a type of well-rounded, competent experimental nuclear scientist who is able to analyze an experimental problem, to select, design, and set up appropriate nuclear instrumentation, and to conduct required measurements. The laboratory sessions will meet twice a week for 2 hours and 40 minutes. The students are expected to write detailed lab reports on their work, and give a presentation on of their experiments at the end of the semester. In addition to the laboratory component of ANSEL students will attend a weekly lecture (1 hour and 15 minutes per week)."

It is then followed by thermodynamics laws and the microscopic understanding of these laws, with the emphasize on statistical definition of entropy, temperature, heat capacity. It continues with the discussions of various type of free energies and Maxwell's relations. These general principles are then applied to study ideal non-interacting classical and quantum molecular systems.

Weekly problem sets are assigned. It begins with a concise example that demonstrates the statistical nature of thermodynamics, followed by discussions of partition functions, and Boltzmann distribution. It is then followed by thermodynamics laws and the microscopic understanding of these laws, with the emphasize on statistical definition of entropy, temperature, heat capacity. It continues with the discussions of various type of free energies and Maxwell's relations. These general principles are then applied to study ideal non-interacting classical and quantum molecular systems. It finishes with the discussions on chemical potentials and phase equilibria, chemical equilibrium, and chemical kinetics. This course uses the Tues/Thurs 8:00 - 9:30 am Common Exam time."

They will acquire practical skills in the routine use of radiation detectors, monitors, and electronics, and develop the ability to assess radiation threats and prospects of their abatement. The four in-depth ANSEL experiments are designed to help recreate a type of well-rounded, competent experimental nuclear scientist who is able to analyze an experimental problem, to select, design, and set up appropriate nuclear instrumentation, and to conduct required measurements. The laboratory sessions will meet twice a week for 2 hours and 40 minutes. The students are expected to write detailed lab reports on their work, and give a presentation on of their experiments at the end of the semester. In addition to the laboratory component of ANSEL students will attend a weekly lecture (1 hour and 15 minutes per week)."

A great deal of literary history is the story of intricately rewriting and adapting the core texts of these traditions; it has been said that the European philosophical tradition is a series of footnotes to Plato. While doing justice to any one of these authors or traditions in a single semester would be a challenge, the goal of this class is to read as much as possible of the classical and scriptural tradition in the short time we have, giving you a solid introduction to some of the key stories and ideas that have generated so much thought, conflict, and human creativity over the past two dozen centuries.

We will trace the historical development of democracy and explore the social factors and big ideas that shaped it into the form of government that almost every society in the world now looks to as a model. You will learn about the various institutions that allowed Athenian society to function and discover what the Athenians thought about their great experiment, even if they thought it was a very bad idea. We will also observe and discuss some of our own government institutions so that we can better understand our system of government, both in what it shares with ancient Athens and how it differs."

What distinguishes them are the unique lenses through which they recount history, offering glimpses of how love, in particular, becomes entangled in politics and war: in Bassani's story, a town ostracizes an older resident for his relationship with a young man during the rise of Fascism; in Fenoglio's tale, a partisan\u2019s memories of his beloved veer him off course during the Resistance; and in Ginzburg's account, a woman relates her antifascist Jewish family\u2019s trials and tribulations under dictatorship. Assignments include: historical, biographical and critical readings, short papers and a final essay. All readings will be in English."

This course focuses on the tangible object that is the source of the image onscreen, and the social, cultural, and historical value of a reel of film as an organic element with a finite life cycle. We focus on the analog photographic element and its origins (both theatrical and small gauge), the basics of photochemical film technology, and film conservation and preservation. Guest lectures by staff of the Moving Image Department of George Eastman Museum provide a first-hand look at analog film and its preservation in action, allowing us to consider it as an ephemeral form of material culture: a multipurpose, visual record that is in addition to being art, entertainment, and evidentiary document, also an historical artifact. There are weekly film assignments. Class meets at George Eastman Museum and on River Campus (transportation provided)."

Paris is a space of freedom and artistic glory that African American writers, soldiers and artists were denied back home. For students from French colonies, Paris was the birthplace of Negritude, the cultural renaissance informed by the Harlem Renaissance. Black Paris, for those caught in poor suburbs, calls to mind images of riots, dilapidated schools, but also rap music and hip-hop, elements of transnational black imagination that sometimes speaks the language of the Black Lives Matter movement.

Several class presentations on readings; one final paper or a composition with an essay about its temporal organization and orientation."

Because of the diversity and complexity of computer hardware, programmers increasingly depend on automation in compilers and other tools to deliver efficient and reliable software. This course combines fundamental principles and (hands-on) practical applications. Specific topics include data flow and dependence theories; static and dynamic program transformation including parallelization; memory and cache management; type checking and program verification; and performance analysis and modeling. The knowledge and practice will help students to become experts in software performance and correctness. Students taking the graduate level will have additional course requirements and a more difficult project."

The final course module will focus on exploring the neuronal mechanisms of attention, again from a neuron- and circuit-centric perspective. Multiple sensory systems will be discussed with primary emphasis on the visual system as a model for understanding structure/function relationships. The course will also introduce students to modern methodological approaches in systems neuroscience. A major goal of the course is to familiarize students with reading and critiquing primary research literature through weekly readings, small group discussions, and short written summaries of scientific papers."

By opening our senses and learning tools for generating movement in real-time, students will unite their bodies and minds to engage in spontaneous investigation and creation. Specific theories and techniques based in the work of Anne Bogart, William Forsythe and Laban Movement Analysis will be explored in addition to wider concepts such as scores, collective composition and site-specific work. The main goals of this class are to provide students with the freedom to explore their own movement-based research interests and to develop their individual artistic voices within a structured environment. Students will also strengthen their presence, intuition, self-awareness and decision-making skills"

After the discussion of RLC circuits, high-frequency narrow-band amplifiers are studied, followed by broadband amplifiers. Then we examine the important issue of noise with the design example of low-noise amplifiers (LNA). Nonlinear circuits are studied next with the examples of mixers. A study of oscillators and phase noise follows. Afterwards we introduce phase-locked loops (PLL) and frequency synthesizers. The course concludes with an overview of transceivers architectures. The course emphasizes the development of both circuit design intuition and analytical skills.

It has scaled multiple generations in feature size and in speed while keeping the same power densities. However,CMOS finally encounters fundamental limits. The course is intended for students interested in research frontiers of future electronics technologies. The course begins with introduction to the basic physics of magnetism and of quantum mechanical spin. Then it covers aspects of spin transport with emphasis on spin-diffusion in semiconductors. The second part of the course is comprised of student and lecturer presentations of selected spintronics topics which may include: spin transistors, magnetic random access memories, spin-based logic paradigms, spin-based lasers and light emitting diodes, magnetic semiconductors, spin-torque devices for memory applications and the spin Hall effect."

The most populous African nation, Nigeria, shows similar inequality among its major ethnic nationalities. This magnitude of inequality among ethnic nationalities has given rise to serious problems in inter-group relations in the three countries.

By integrating concepts of radiogenic isotope geochemistry, diffusion kinetics and analytical geochemistry, this course will explore the principles and applications of geochronology, thermochronology and geospeedometry. Students are expected to have a general knowledge of mineralogy, petrology and basic thermodynamics prior to taking this course."

In this practical class, students will build simple biogeochemical models-ranging from \"box\" models of marine microbial ecosystems to three-dimensional nutrient cycling models-and design experiments to address climate change hypotheses. They will also be taught to analyze output from state-of-the-art climate models used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

How should we understand the meaning and value of life and death? We will also explore related general questions: Is it always possible for a good enough end to justify bad means?

Taking as a case study New York's Adirondack Park, the oldest and largest state preserve in the nation, we will study the many ways in which humans have interacted with and conceptualized nature, landscape, and wilderness. Topics will include colonial settlement and Native American displacement, the forest industry, the romantic invention of wilderness, the history of the park, and contemporary conflicts over wilderness protection and land use. The course features an optional three-day excursion to the Adirondack High Peaks Wilderness."

While this course offers a set of thinking tools, it will also deal with some case studies of specific material objects, including a material history of glass, Chinese ceramics in the global circuits, poetics of the screen and the window.

We'll ask what distinguishes diaspora from exile, how a former life can follow a person to new places. We'll read about perilous Mediterranean crossings, LGBTQ persecution, undocumented life in America, and children dreaming of distant lands.

Actually, science fiction falls under the very large umbrella of \"Fantasy,\" which used to dominate creative writings before the introduction of the \"novel.\" This course is not, per se, a course on \"genre\" literature--a term I loathe because even \"literary\" or \"mainstream\" fiction has \"genres.\" I am interested in leading you to write short fiction that straddles conventional generic boundaries, such as the work of Margaret Atwood, A.S.

So what do copy editors do? Is copyediting simply about enforcing rules of correctness? When is it okay to break those rules, or to allow others to do so, and what guides such decisions? How do copy editors understand and negotiate the relationships and interests of readers, writers, and the publications they work for? How has the information age changed the way copy editors think about and approach textual editing? In this class we will address both the principles and practices of copyediting. Students will learn the principles that guide copy editors, and then put these principles into use in a workshop setting, practicing copyediting in a variety of contexts, including digital communications."

To find out, we will begin roughly 5,000 years ago,studying the common ancestor of languages as different as English, Hindi, and Polish: Proto-Indo-European. We will learn about the prehistoric roots of English, then turn to the earliest written evidence of it: \u201cAnglo-Saxon\u201d or \u201cOld English,\u201d ca. 600-1100.The language was transformed in the wake of the Norman Invasion of 1066, as English became lower in status than both Anglo-Norman French and Latin for a few centuries. Next, we will learn about the growth of English, and its changes, in the age of Chaucer (Middle English) and Shakespeare (Early Modern English). Finally, we will explore processes of standardization, hybridization, and diffusion in the complex effects of English\u2019s spread across the globe over the course of the past 450 years."

Perhaps most interesting is the international influence of Shakespeare on screen.

How do those productions merge Shakespeare\u2019s text with the cultural traditions of their modern film-makers? What role, if any, does post-colonialism play in that enterprise? We will begin our work by reading selected scenes from several of Shakespeare\u2019s plays.

As we read Frederick Douglass\u2019s slave narrative, Henry Thoreau\u2019s Walden, Rachel Carson\u2019s Silent Spring, Toni Morrison\u2019s Song of Solomon, Leslie Silko\u2019s Ceremony, and more, we will explore how these creative authors have left us an archive of historical traces that can help us understand our own environmental experiences today. Topics covered include colonialism, ecotourism, slavery, civil rights, trauma, technology, urbanization, the rise of science, and students can expect to explore questions such as, What are the environmental politics of race? How do indigenous writers respond to the trauma of losing homelands? How to communicate the hazards of climate change? How do we create a meaningful connection to home and the planet amidst so much injustice and technological upheaval?"

We focus on the analog photographic element and its origins (both theatrical and small gauge), the basics of photochemical film technology, and film conservation and preservation. Guest lectures by staff of the Moving Image Department of George Eastman Museum provide a first-hand look at analog film and its preservation in action, allowing us to consider it as an ephemeral form of material culture: a multipurpose, visual record that is in addition to being art, entertainment, and evidentiary document, also an historical artifact. There are weekly film assignments. Class meets at George Eastman Museum and on River Campus (transportation provided)."

When you watch a Hitchcock film, you are meant to be acutely aware that it is Hitchcock\u2019s film. This course examines how exactly that works.More than a proper noun, \u201cHitchcock\u201d implies a formal style, a dramatic genre and a paradigm of postwar Autuerism and influence. This course revolves around a close examination of fifteen out of the director\u2019s fifty films, as well as samples from his television series. Without pardoning his socially insensitive shortcomings (i.e. misogynist \u201cheros,\u201d mistreatment of leading ladies, use of blackface, etc.) we will unpack just what constitutes the \u201cHitchcock\u201d touch. From his British silents to his Hollywood \u201cmasterpieces\u201d to his final works, this course considers the ways in which Hitchcock devised a relation among narrative, spectator and character point of view, so as to yield his singular configuration of suspense, sensation and perception."

In short stories, a novel (Toni Morrison\u2019s Beloved), and film we will explore the nature and function of the impulse to tell stories, and the links between narrative, memory, and identities, both individual and communal. Students will also be encouraged to explore the storytelling potential of music."

The perspective of the course is historical and critical. The key assumption is that media\u2014the human voice, manuscripts, printed books, telegrams, photos, film, TV, paintings, electronic files--shape their \"content\"--words, pictures, sounds\u2014and also shape their authors and their audiences. There have always been media because life cannot be lived without them. We are now experiencing a digital revolution. This remarkable media shift puts us among the first explorers to arrive on the scene of epoch-making changes. We should take advantage of our own unique intellectual opportunity to look back on the history of media from the powerful new perspective of digital media\u2014and also to contemplate the great void that no medium has yet filled, the spaces of communication that we cannot yet cross."

Students can draw on pre-existing research interests from their majors or develop a line of inquiry stemming from class discussions, writing, and research. In order to gain experience writing to a range of readers, students will engage in a writing process informed by peer review, self-assessment, and revision. Shorter writing assignments will help students develop and refine ideas as they transform texts for different audiences.

Literary language acts on us mostly without our awareness. With attention to a variety of genres of fiction, poetry, drama, and popular song lyrics, the seminar estimates the social and political speech action of literary language. Seminar members are invited to re-use the language of the works on the reading list by placing this language in new contexts and then comparing the new usages with those experienced in reading. Works on the reading list, which raise issues of language action, suggest how such actions appear in any literature. Authors studied include Dickinson, Kafka, Lawrence, Morrison, Olds, Orwell, Pinter, and Shakespeare. Obscene language is considered as a model of how literary language is politically active."

Where did today\u2019s standard English come from, and how is our sense of that standard tied to assumptions about race, class, gender, and nationality? To find out, we will begin roughly 5,000 years ago,studying the common ancestor of languages as different as English, Hindi, and Polish: Proto-Indo-European. We will learn about the prehistoric roots of English, then turn to the earliest written evidence of it: \u201cAnglo-Saxon\u201d or \u201cOld English,\u201d ca. 600-1100.The language was transformed in the wake of the Norman Invasion of 1066, as English became lower in status than both Anglo-Norman French and Latin for a few centuries. Next, we will learn about the growth of English, and its changes, in the age of Chaucer (Middle English) and Shakespeare (Early Modern English). Finally, we will explore processes of standardization, hybridization, and diffusion in the complex effects of English\u2019s spread across the globe over the course of the past 450 years."

We\u2019ll explore the vivid writings of England reflected in monastic poetry (surprisingly sensuous), Wonders of the East, Book of Monsters, comets, portents, charms, riddles, the Paternoster and the Devil, maps, visions, wolves, women, runes, cross-dressing saints. It also examines English bigotries, linguistic eccentricities, and cultural diversity.

They also gain a perspective on the Biblical, Christian, and Classical traditions as they intersect with the multiple levels of Dante\u2019s concern, ranging from literature to history, from politics to government, from philosophy to theology. A visual component, including illustrations of the \"Comedy\" and multiple artworks pertinent to the narrative, complements the course.

As authors experimented with new modes of portraying consciousness and the external world, and explored new ideas about plot, character, and narrative voice, they questioned what the novel could do: how does the novel, as opposed to other genres, approach the relationship between reality and representation? Does it imply a new kind of reading experience? a new kind of reader? Does it owe its existence to certain historical, social, or cultural circumstances? Authors include Aphra Behn, Daniel Defoe, Samuel Richardson, Henry Fielding, Laurence Sterne, and Jane Austen. Counts toward the pre-1800 requirement."

We focus on the analog photographic element and its origins (both theatrical and small gauge), the basics of photochemical film technology, and film conservation and preservation. Guest lectures by staff of the Moving Image Department of George Eastman Museum provide a first-hand look at analog film and its preservation in action, allowing us to consider it as an ephemeral form of material culture: a multipurpose, visual record that is in addition to being art, entertainment, and evidentiary document, also an historical artifact.

To that end, we will read both one another's poems and poems by established authors, in either case paying attention to the ways in which the authors harness aspects of their medium, the English language: syntax, diction, rhythm. The poems we write may take any shape, any form, but we will work towards understanding why a particular poem must take the shape it has; we will pay attention not so much to what the poems say as to how they say it. Requirements: weekly writing and reading assignments, revisions of assignments, devoted participation in class discussions, a final project."

To answer these questions, students will also think deeply about how context does or does not shape our understanding of these concepts. For instance, what do arguments in STEM fields have in common with those in the humanities? Do different fields such as philosophy, psychology, and biology share evidence and argumentative strategies? Is the meaning of evidence static across these fields? We will begin by investigating different models of argument from philosophy and argumentation theory, and then students will use these broad models to investigate and analyze argument in academic contexts of their choice. We will also explore how these theoretical accounts of argument apply to popular contexts such as advertising, public deliberation, and journalism. Students will explore these issues through reflective writing, several short papers and a research project of their own design."

We will survey appropriate theories of language and communication including semiotics, post-structuralism, pragmatics, discourse analysis, and cognitive linguistics. We will consider varied and conflicting descriptions by translators of what it is they believe they are doing and what they hope to accomplish by doing it; and we will study specific translations into English from a variety of sources in order to investigate the strategies and choices translators make and the implication of those choices for our developing sense of what kinds of texts translations actually are. Finally, students will, in consultation with the instructor or with another qualified faculty member, undertake exercises in translation of their own. By the end of this class each student should have a working knowledge of both the critical backgrounds and the artistic potentials of translation."

We will examine its social, political, and moral commentary across medieval, renaissance, and nineteenth-century European literature. How the Fairy signals both instability and literary self-fashioning: in the grafting of histories and genealogies with fairy ancestors (Melusine, Historia Regum Brittoniae, The Faerie Queene); in the troubling overlap between civilization and nature (A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream, Undine); or as a site of loss, childhood, poetry, & the rise of \u201ctheosophy\u201d in the 19th C. (Keats, Yeats, Tennyson, Hewitt, Barrie, Conan Doyle) Throughout time, readers have been fascinated by a \u201chidden people\u201dnot entirely foreign, evil, or human who abduct them, deceive them, seduce them, and make them poets"

How can critics and researchers deal with the inaccessibility of so much television from even the recent past, much less more distant decades? What archeologies of television are possible? How is television related to wider cultural formations--from other media and arts to the lived experiences of race, gender, sexuality, and class? What do answers to these questions tell us about what it means to watch TV? The course will mix reading about and watching television in pursuing answers to these questions"

      "description": "Led by Master Drummer Fana Bangoura, the West African Drumming Ensemble is dedicated to the dynamic percussive traditions of Guinea. The ensemble combines the iconic djembe hand drum with a trio of drums played with sticks, known as dunun, sangban, and kenkeni. The powerful, multi-part relationships established by this trio of drums provide a rhythmic foundation for the ensemble, enabling djembe players to develop technique in executing both accompaniment and solo parts. Drawing upon his experience as a soloist with the internationally acclaimed groups Les Percussions de Guin\u00e9e and Les Ballets Africains, Fana engages ensemble players with a wide repertory of music from various regions of Guinea, including the rhythms of the Susu, Malinke, and Baga language groups."

Teams will present their idea-filtering rationale to a panel for review and feedback.\nBehind this evaluation process, the class will review reference material on the subject and several accomplished entrepreneurs will share their personal experiences.\nWhile the nomenclature will align most directly to high-technology for-profit start-up companies, parallels to low-tech-no-tech, intra-preneurship, non-profits, and social entrepreneurship will be discussed."

Management issues discussed include organizational development, analysis of market opportunities, market engagement, financial planning and control, capitalization, sources of funds, the due-diligence process and valuing the venture.\nAn important reason for taking this course is to learn how to develop a business plan. Therefore, a significant component of a student's final grade will be based on this. In too many instances, a new venture does not become a viable entity because either there is no plan, or if there is, it is poorly conceived. Furthermore, a good plan is an effective communications tool for the investment community. An additional benefit is learning to work in multidisciplinary teams."

We will explore what it is that an ethnomusicologist does (or once did) by studying a variety of approaches to fieldwork methods and ethnographic representation. We will explore several theoretical orientations\u2014drawing from the disciplines of anthropology, linguistics, performance theory, media studies, and philosophy\u2014that inform the work of past and present ethnomusicologists, and introduce a range of musical styles, practices, and ways of thinking about sound in different parts of the world through the study of select musical ethnographies."

The investment theory part starts from partial equilibrium (mean-variance analysis) and proceeds with general equilibrium (CAPM). We test it with the data, discuss factor models and anomalies, and use it to evaluate the efficiency of markets. We then study derivatives (options, forwards, futures and swaps). Replication strategies are used to price derivatives, and the binomial model of option pricing is derived. We conclude with the Black-Scholes formula.

The course draws connections between these concepts and makes plain the similarities between discrete and continuous time models. Applications include term structure models, portfolio choices and the pricing of corporate securities."

Since the mid-20 century, television has occupied a central place in U.S. cultural production and thus serves as a nexus where concerns with gender as well as sexuality, class, and race are negotiated. To interrogate these negotiations, the course will attend to the shifts in the industrial arrangement of television and to corresponding shifts in television\u2019s formal arrangement. It asks not only how gender has been represented on television but also how gender functions in the television industry and how it functions within a televisual aesthetic. It traces the role of gender in many of television studies prominent theories: flow, liveness, televisuality, quality TV, and media convergence. The course will cover both nonfiction and fiction, looking at a range of television genres: sitcom, soap operas, news, primetime drama, cartoons, music videos, commercials, and Netflix original content."

In looking at these, we will consider both the approaches that key scholars in the field of media studies use, and the concepts that are central to the field itself (media/medium; medium-specificity; remediation; the culture industry; reification and utopia; cultural politics).

This was hardly the case. In fact, the 1930s was a decade of diverse artistic experiments in the United States\u2014a veritable laboratory for debating art\u2019s forms and social aims that would come to redefine American culture itself. This course introduces a range of those experiments, focusing on the network between film and the other visual arts. Topics include federally sponsored New Deal programs, the social realisms of African-American and immigrant artists, the rise of photo-journalism and emergence of \u201cdocumentary\u201d across mediums, the aesthetic diplomacy of World\u2019s Fairs and films such as Capra\u2019s American Madness, Lang\u2019s Fury, and Ford\u2019s Grapes of Wrath. Throughout the course we will be asking in what ways did these experiments represent propositions about the direction and shape of modern art and culture in America."

The key assumption is that media\u2014the human voice, manuscripts, printed books, telegrams, photos, film, TV, paintings, electronic files--shape their \"content\"--words, pictures, sounds\u2014and also shape their authors and their audiences. There have always been media because life cannot be lived without them. We are now experiencing a digital revolution. This remarkable media shift puts us among the first explorers to arrive on the scene of epoch-making changes. We should take advantage of our own unique intellectual opportunity to look back on the history of media from the powerful new perspective of digital media\u2014and also to contemplate the great void that no medium has yet filled, the spaces of communication that we cannot yet cross."

After developing a core vocabulary for thinking about comics as a medium we will then look at how artists and directors have drawn on that vocabulary in a range of different contexts. Retaining a sense of the specificity of both comics and film as artistic mediums, we will closely consider topics ranging from cross-cultural translation, ontologies of otherness, and modes of mediated history.

He worked as a poet, novelist, filmmaker, playwright and essayist, creating scandal with his radical critique of Italy\u2019s modernization and rising consumer culture in the 1960s. As a director, he made some of the most challenging and controversial works in film history. This course gives students a solid understanding of his films by examining how each work addresses Italy\u2019s transformation from a premodern agrarian and artisanal culture, to a modern capitalist one. Films include: Accattone, Mamma Roma, The Hawks and the Sparrows, Theorem, The Decameron and Sal\u00f2. To provide students with a foundation in Pasolini\u2019s thought and in film analysis, discussions will focus on both thematic and formal issues, such as Marxist politics, Catholicism, sexuality, homoeroticism, violence and his pastiche style. Assignments include: readings, screenings, papers and a final essay. Readings and screenings will be in English."

Guest lectures by staff of the Moving Image Department of George Eastman Museum provide a first-hand look at analog film and its preservation in action, allowing us to consider it as an ephemeral form of material culture: a multipurpose, visual record that is in addition to being art, entertainment, and evidentiary document, also an historical artifact.

Meanwhile, for legal and mental health professions, proof of guilt is used to sort the good from the bad, the normal from the deviant, and the socially respectable from the socially disposable. Not all is so dour, however. Guilt lives in confession, denunciation, and in criminal sentencing, but it is also the stuff of jokes, of ethnic pride, and of eroticism. Toward an anatomy of guilt, in this course we will draw on the works of Freud, Nietzsche, Arendt, Foucault, Janet Malcolm and Sarah Schulman, and we will wrestle with the films\u2014and complicated legacies\u2014of Alfred Hitchcock and Woody Allen, two filmmakers who are preoccupied with (and implicated by) guilt, as feeling and as fact."

This course examines how exactly that works.More than a proper noun, \u201cHitchcock\u201d implies a formal style, a dramatic genre and a paradigm of postwar Autuerism and influence. This course revolves around a close examination of fifteen out of the director\u2019s fifty films, as well as samples from his television series. Without pardoning his socially insensitive shortcomings (i.e. misogynist \u201cheros,\u201d mistreatment of leading ladies, use of blackface, etc.) we will unpack just what constitutes the \u201cHitchcock\u201d touch. From his British silents to his Hollywood \u201cmasterpieces\u201d to his final works, this course considers the ways in which Hitchcock devised a relation among narrative, spectator and character point of view, so as to yield his singular configuration of suspense, sensation and perception."

This course focuses on the tangible object that is the source of the image onscreen, and the social, cultural, and historical value of a reel of film as an organic element with a finite life cycle. We focus on the analog photographic element and its origins (both theatrical and small gauge), the basics of photochemical film technology, and film conservation and preservation. Guest lectures by staff of the Moving Image Department of George Eastman Museum provide a first-hand look at analog film and its preservation in action, allowing us to consider it as an ephemeral form of material culture: a multipurpose, visual record that is in addition to being art, entertainment, and evidentiary document, also an historical artifact. There are weekly film assignments. Class meets at George Eastman Museum and on River Campus (transportation provided)."

It traces the historical development of film theory from 1900 to the 1950s. We will begin with on thinkers in the period of early cinema, including Germaine Dulac, Jean and Marie Epstein, and then we will examine the development of film theory in the work of later theorists, such as Jean Mitry, Sergei Eisenstein, Dziga Vertov, Siegfried Kracauer, Walter Benjamin, Andre Bazin and Christian Metz. Weekly screenings of historically contemporary films will allow us to examine the ongoing dialogue between the evolving medium and the developing theoretical discussion."

GBA 490, which cannot be used to complete a concentration in the M.B.A. program, is open only to non-U.S. students who are eligible to work in the United States. Upon completion of the internship assignment, the student must prepare a 10- to 12-page report detailing its outcome(s) and stating whether the proposed learning objectives were met."

We will explore a multitude of feminist perspectives on the intersections of sex, gender, sexuality, race, ethnicity, class, religion, and other categories of identity.

This class offers a space in which we approach disabilities, from depression and anxiety to autism to spina bifida, as well as Deaf culture, chronic illnesses, body size, sexual orientation and gender identity, and many other forms of difference as complex sites of social expectations, personal experiences, state interventions, knowledge production, and exuberant life."

Meanwhile, for legal and mental health professions, proof of guilt is used to sort the good from the bad, the normal from the deviant, and the socially respectable from the socially disposable. Not all is so dour, however. Guilt lives in confession, denunciation, and in criminal sentencing, but it is also the stuff of jokes, of ethnic pride, and of eroticism. Toward an anatomy of guilt, in this course we will draw on the works of Freud, Nietzsche, Arendt, Foucault, Janet Malcolm and Sarah Schulman, and we will wrestle with the films\u2014and complicated legacies\u2014of Alfred Hitchcock and Woody Allen, two filmmakers who are preoccupied with (and implicated by) guilt, as feeling and as fact."

For instance, what do arguments in STEM fields have in common with those in the humanities? Do different fields such as philosophy, psychology, and biology share evidence and argumentative strategies? Is the meaning of evidence static across these fields? We will begin by investigating different models of argument from philosophy and argumentation theory, and then students will use these broad models to investigate and analyze argument in academic contexts of their choice. We will also explore how these theoretical accounts of argument apply to popular contexts such as advertising, public deliberation, and journalism.

Topics include human rights and world religions, the influence of the American and French Revolutions, the creation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights after World War II, the history of organizations such as Amnesty International and institutions such as the International Criminal Court, questions about the role of humanitarian intervention and the evolution of the responsibility to protect, and controversies around events such as the 1995 World Conference on Women in Beijing, the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development in Rio de Janeiro, and the 2010 Summit on the Millennium Development Goals in New York City."

The result was a divide between Protestant confessions and Catholicism. Protestantism, however, was not a monolithic entity even in its earliest years as this course will pursue. Although these reformations had worldwide consequences, the focus here will be on the events in sixteenth-century Europe. Students will learn to appreciate the complicated history of religious changes during the early modern period without succumbing to confessional rectitude. The themes and subjects studied in the course are relevant for those interested in medieval and modern history. Theology is but one part of this course with the place of print technology, vernacularization, and political mobilization in the reformations also receiving significant attention throughout the semester."

This course explores four of those areas: evangelical ties connecting African American churches with South Africa\u2019s independent church organizations; the spread of Booker T. Washington\u2019s educational ideals in black South African academic circles; the impact of the Harlem Renaissance on African popular township culture; and the cross-fertilization of political ideologies originating on both sides of the Atlantic: Africans fighting against apartheid learned important lessons from the crusades of anti-colonial activists and internationalists in the diaspora, such as Marcus Garvey, Paul Robeson, and Mahatma Gandhi."

This course will address modern caricatures of the Crusades by introducing students to the full range of political, social, and religious issues involved. Students will be encouraged to see the Crusades as a Mediterranean wide phenomenon, including encounters between Christians and Muslims in the Iberian Peninsula, Sicily, and the Levant. The course will go well beyond military history by looking at contemporary understandings of Jihad, Crusade, religious duty, and daily life. It will encourage students to think about compromise and acquiescence in intercultural contact as well as the conditions under which interaction breaks down. Students will read contemporary interpretations of conflict in selected (translated) primary sources from Arabic, Greek, Latin, and Hebrew. Finally, the course will conclude by considering the legacy of the Crusades in the modern Middle East and Western culture."

There are few jobs older than that of a spy. The term has seen many shifting connotations throughout the millennia. However, its most fundamental definition remained the same. One who spies is one who watches secretly and sees the experiences of others. How was this accomplished? Why was it done? Whom did it benefit, and why? These are questions we will study in this survey history of espionage that will span from the ancient world to the present. Through the use of movies, literature and other cultural elements, this class will confront the political, cultural, and social implications of espionage in world history. It will also consider how our modern understanding of espionage can be evaluated as part of current American identity."

We will explore life on the Soviet home front, the Holocaust and life in the occupied territories, partisan warfare, the significance of Lend Lease for the Soviet war effort, soldiers' experience of the war, and key battles. This last will include the Battle of Moscow in the winter of 1941-1942, the first defeat inflicted on the Germans in World War II, and the Battle of Stalingrad, the great turning point of World War II in Europe."

The most populous African nation, Nigeria, shows similar inequality among its major ethnic nationalities. This magnitude of inequality among ethnic nationalities has given rise to serious problems in inter-group relations in the three countries.

Students will analyze and evaluate miracles in several contexts with the aid of recent scholarship and a rich array of primary sources, including religious texts, polemics, and films. They will also learn broad applicable skills, such as the synthesis of ideas, investigation of controversial subjects with respectful criticism, and the effective articulation of brief and extended arguments."

In addition to learning more about Rochester\u2019s own history, students can expect to explore how elements of ethnography, public outreach, design, and digital technology contribute to public history. As a culmination, students will lead the launch of the exhibit at an off-campus site for the greater Rochester community."

In this course, we will consider these questions and more as we explore how women\u2019s reproductive experiences and the meanings attached to such experiences have changed over time and why.

Inversely, how does politics or persecution influence the production, distribution, and circulation of literary works? We will investigate the underlying themes and metaphors of novels, short stories, poetry, and cinema from across Asia, Africa, and the Middle East that reflect on these questions while at the same time we will frame our discussions by key texts from a variety of humanistic and social science disciplines. Larger questions of global peace, freedom of expression, human rights, solidarity, and activism in post-9/11 era will be inseparable from our discussions of globalization, empire, modernity, and nationalism."

Working collaboratively toward this goal, students will research an aspect of their musicianship in depth as they explore and apply ideas about creativity to music, and develop a framework for evaluating the many different approaches to this topic.  This course is useful for advanced non-native speakers of English, as well as students interested in developing professional skills in an intercultural environment."

The central challenge for humanity in the 21st century is how to address the triple issue of ending extreme poverty, improving social inclusion, and achieving sustainability for the planet. The 13 weeks of the course include a significant practical element. Students will work in small groups for a partner organization (a business or non-profit) involved in this topic to complete a project that helps achieve the organization\u2019s mission and contributes to sustainable development.

Using different approaches and theories (modernism, ethno-symbolism, ethnic and civic nationalism), it aims at applying them to both historical and contemporary reality. Beginning with pre-modern forms of national identity (\u201cnoble nation\u201d), the course will focus on the processes of formation modern nations in Central Europe and their consequences for the history of the region in 20th century.

We will also analyze how they have adapted into cinema historical events such as the 16th wars between the Guelphs and the Ghibellines and witch hunting in Europe, paying particular attention to how they have used opera music, particularly Verdi\u2019s music."

      "description": "Pier Paolo Pasolini is one of Italy\u2019s major 20th-century artists and intellectuals. He worked as a poet, novelist, filmmaker, playwright and essayist, creating scandal with his radical critique of Italy\u2019s modernization and rising consumer culture in the 1960s. As a director, he made some of the most challenging and controversial works in film history. This course gives students a solid understanding of his films by examining how each work addresses Italy\u2019s transformation from a premodern agrarian and artisanal culture, to a modern capitalist one. Films include: Accattone, Mamma Roma, The Hawks and the Sparrows, Theorem, The Decameron and Sal\u00f2. To provide students with a foundation in Pasolini\u2019s thought and in film analysis, discussions will focus on both thematic and formal issues, such as Marxist politics, Catholicism, sexuality, homoeroticism, violence and his pastiche style. Assignments include: readings, screenings, papers and a final essay. Readings and screenings will be in English."

      "description": "When we look at works of art in museums, galleries, and churches we are, in most cases, looking at them out of context. Furthermore, when we look at early Renaissance paintings we do not see them through the eyes of the people who produced them or for whom they were produced. We have to learn to see them as they might have been seen. We can begin to do this by learning how to read and to interpret the complex elements at play beneath the immediate surface by setting the artist, his work, and his public in their social and religious historical contexts, and by exploring the universal unspoken language of signs and symbols used by artists. The course content is based on painted forms, i.e., panels, canvases, and frescos from the Trecento and Quattrocento with an emphasis on Tuscan painting. The selection, as far as possible, takes advantage of the availability of works in churches, museums, and galleries within easy visiting distance of Arezzo."

In this course, we will explore three of the era's most remarkable works: Giorgio Bassani's The Gold-Rimmed Spectacles, Beppe Fenoglio's A Private Affair and Natalia Ginzburg's Family Lexicon. What distinguishes them are the unique lenses through which they recount history, offering glimpses of how love, in particular, becomes entangled in politics and war: in Bassani's story, a town ostracizes an older resident for his relationship with a young man during the rise of Fascism; in Fenoglio's tale, a partisan\u2019s memories of his beloved veer him off course during the Resistance; and in Ginzburg's account, a woman relates her antifascist Jewish family\u2019s trials and tribulations under dictatorship. Assignments include: historical, biographical and critical readings, short papers and a final essay. All readings will be in English."

Guest lectures by staff of the Moving Image Department of George Eastman Museum provide a first-hand look at analog film and its preservation in action, allowing us to consider it as an ephemeral form of material culture: a multipurpose, visual record that is in addition to being art, entertainment, and evidentiary document, also an historical artifact. There are weekly film assignments. Class meets at George Eastman Museum and on River Campus (transportation provided)."

Recurrent iconography and coded images link tourism and educational objects and images with evolving concepts of nationalism and cultural identity. How is the meaning of modern in Japan useful to a study of the continuous transformation of culture in specific contexts, as in the transition from ukiyo-e culture to photography and animated films.

This course focuses on the tangible object that is the source of the image onscreen, and the social, cultural, and historical value of a reel of film as an organic element with a finite life cycle. We focus on the analog photographic element and its origins (both theatrical and small gauge), the basics of photochemical film technology, and film conservation and preservation. Guest lectures by staff of the Moving Image Department of George Eastman Museum provide a first-hand look at analog film and its preservation in action, allowing us to consider it as an ephemeral form of material culture: a multipurpose, visual record that is in addition to being art, entertainment, and evidentiary document, also an historical artifact. There are weekly film assignments. Class meets at George Eastman Museum and on River Campus (transportation provided)."

Illustrations, guidebooks, photographs, and films reflect changing concepts of urban space, rural culture, industry, geography, and military and political authority. Recurrent iconography and coded images link tourism and educational objects and images with evolving concepts of nationalism and cultural identity. How is the meaning of modern in Japan useful to a study of the continuous transformation of culture in specific contexts, as in the transition from ukiyo-e culture to photography and animated films. This course has a digital component: students work (hands on) with the Re-Envisioning Japan Research Collection in curating their own digital exhibitions. Weekly film assignments.

Meanwhile, for legal and mental health professions, proof of guilt is used to sort the good from the bad, the normal from the deviant, and the socially respectable from the socially disposable. Not all is so dour, however. Guilt lives in confession, denunciation, and in criminal sentencing, but it is also the stuff of jokes, of ethnic pride, and of eroticism. Toward an anatomy of guilt, in this course we will draw on the works of Freud, Nietzsche, Arendt, Foucault, Janet Malcolm and Sarah Schulman, and we will wrestle with the films\u2014and complicated legacies\u2014of Alfred Hitchcock and Woody Allen, two filmmakers who are preoccupied with (and implicated by) guilt, as feeling and as fact."

Students will learn to develop the ability to see patterns in grammar, as well as its structural possibilities and limits. Assignments will regularly involve reflection on form, usage and speaker judgments. Through a final project, students will investigate some aspect of an English variety available to them. Throughout, students will be working with their data samples of English to explore how speaker choices lead to particular grammatical structures or yield ungrammaticality.

We will learn about the prehistoric roots of English, then turn to the earliest written evidence of it: \u201cAnglo-Saxon\u201d or \u201cOld English,\u201d ca. 600-1100.The language was transformed in the wake of the Norman Invasion of 1066, as English became lower in status than both Anglo-Norman French and Latin for a few centuries. Next, we will learn about the growth of English, and its changes, in the age of Chaucer (Middle English) and Shakespeare (Early Modern English). Finally, we will explore processes of standardization, hybridization, and diffusion in the complex effects of English\u2019s spread across the globe over the course of the past 450 years."

Starting with the notion \u2018phoneme\u2019, the course focuses on acoustic and articulatory phonetics, as a basis for understanding phonological processes and change in linguistic sound forms. Students will acquire skills in the production, recognition, and transcription of sounds in various languages of the world. The course will serve as a foundation for work in language documentation, sociolinguistics and sociophonetics, morphology. This course can be taken as LIN 210 or as LIN 410 and is meant for linguistics majors and non-majors alike. In addition to the lecture students will need to register for a peer-led workshop."

      "description": "This course takes up translation process as an object of study. How do translators work? What opportunities and constraints are present for freelance, specialist, or professional translators? To what extent do translators not only transmit but actively create knowledge and build community via their work of interpreting and adapting? We\u2019ll explore a range of potentially high-stakes cases involving textual, audiovisual, and multimodal renditions of a source text. These may include translating an ad or museum label; subbing a TED Talk or performance; dubbing in anime or games; interpreting for business, medical, or other purposes. Along with course readings and short experimental translations, students will work with our paraprofessional consultants and community partners in SW Rochester to craft final projects that provide a meaningful extension of course learning to real-world issues (Counts toward the Citation in Community-Engaged Scholarship; see Authentically Urban, Virtually Global: Southwest Rochester)."

We will survey appropriate theories of language and communication including semiotics, post-structuralism, pragmatics, discourse analysis, and cognitive linguistics. We will consider varied and conflicting descriptions by translators of what it is they believe they are doing and what they hope to accomplish by doing it; and we will study specific translations into English from a variety of sources in order to investigate the strategies and choices translators make and the implication of those choices for our developing sense of what kinds of texts translations actually are. Finally, students will, in consultation with the instructor or with another qualified faculty member, undertake exercises in translation of their own. By the end of this class each student should have a working knowledge of both the critical backgrounds and the artistic potentials of translation."

The course includes several case studies of major historical bridges selected for their structural significance. Students learn how to calculate the forces acting on structural elements, how these forces depend on the bridge structural form, how the form itself is conditioned by the structural materials, and how forces are measured with electromechanical instrumentation. The study includes fundamental notions of mechanics, strength of materials, structural behavior, instrumentation failure analysis, and design optimization. Working on teams, students use constructive experimental models as well as computer-aided programs to design, build, instrument, and test realistic bridge projects. This is a self-contained course open to all Rochester undergraduates."

This period bears witness to a number of dynamic social and political changes that impact musical production and reception, including the rise of printing press and of Protestantism. Overviews of the cultural landscape will contextualize the activity of composers and musicians under investigation. Areas of emphasis include the development of vocal genres (motet, Mass, chanson, madrigal), as well as distinctive types of instrumental music. Basic theoretical underpinnings such as mode, hexachord, and notational conventions are covered. There will be some attention to reading period notation and engagement with digital advancements and tools in the study of Renaissance music."

Topics of inquiry will include performance practices, organ instruments and continuo techniques, conflicting theological and social ideas of Baroque and Enlightenment Catholicism, reforms associated with Josephinist Vienna and regional civic/religious structures, and the \u201cdramatizing\u201d of theological principles in liturgical music using Classical compositional conventions. Students participate in class discussions of the works and topics and develop research projects regarding the intersection of scholarship and performance, resulting in a formal presentation and paper, with the possibility of including a performance activity in the project."

Many of the important shifts in musical culture during this period\u2014including the emergence of the work concept and the increasing importance of the score as object of reverence\u2014have been invoked to explain improvisation\u2019s decline or marginalization by the turn of the twentieth century. We will critically evaluate such broad changes, asking whether they truly did act to suppress improvisation and if so, how. Focusing on improvisation in poetry, opera, and keyboard performance, as well as critical reception of virtuosi and improvisers, we will move beyond the musical scene and seek to trace improvisation\u2019s importance in wider cultural contexts."

Over the last thirty years or so, both performers and scholars have increasingly engaged them. In this seminar, we will consider Handel\u2019s operas and cantatas from multiple perspectives, highlighting especially their status as literary, musical, and cultural practices. We will also consider the relevant performance techniques of the era. This approach should help us both to comprehend how these works communicated to their original audiences and to suggest ways they might continue to communicate today.

Coming to the understanding that a recording is often a performance in itself, and not necessarily a mere document of a live performance, will be an issue, but more importantly: what music is in the recording? What in the recorded performance is there because of, despite, or unrelated to (and therefore \u201cfree\u201d of) the technology employed?

Readings will illustrate the broad spectrum of aesthetic, moral, and historical concerns that made up the Romantic movement.

It plays a vital role in biblical thought, ancient Greek philosophy and mysticism, scholastic theology, nineteenth century romantic literature, ancient and modern mathematics, and physics. A small sample of the questions we will explore are: 1) How is it possible to even think about the infinite? 2) What does it mean for God to be infinite? 3) The infinite or the finite, which is better, and why has the answer differed in different cultures? Readings will be from numerous sources, including Plato, Aristotle, Euclid, Aquinas, Nicholas of Cusa, Bruno, Newton, Berkeley, Blake, Wordsworth, Cantor, and Borges. The course should fit well into various mathematics and humanities clusters. Cross referenced with PHL 199 and CLA 199"

The topics include Fourier series, separation of variables, Sturm-Liouville theory, unbounded domains and the Fourier transform, spherical coordinates and Legendre\u2019s equation, cylindrical coordinates and Bessel\u2019s equation. The software package Mathematica will be used extensively. Prior knowledge of Mathematica is helpful but not essential. In the last two weeks of the course, there will be a project on an assigned topic. The course will include applications in heat conduction, electrostatics, fluid flow, and acoustics."

Studying the HIV/AIDS epidemic through the lens of musical expression, we will ask how individuals and communities affected by HIV/AIDS have mobilized musical sound in response to the disease. Topics addressed within the class will include musical representations of HIV/AIDS within queer communities; the use of music in public health campaigns to raise awareness about the disease; and the mobilization of musical performance within grassroots support groups for individuals affected by HIV/AIDS."

The ensemble combines the iconic djembe hand drum with a trio of drums played with sticks, known as dunun, sangban, and kenkeni. The powerful, multi-part relationships established by this trio of drums provide a rhythmic foundation for the ensemble, enabling djembe players to develop technique in executing both accompaniment and solo parts. Drawing upon his experience as a soloist with the internationally acclaimed groups Les Percussions de Guin\u00e9e and Les Ballets Africains, Fana engages ensemble players with a wide repertory of music from various regions of Guinea, including the rhythms of the Susu, Malinke, and Baga language groups."

Multiple sensory systems will be discussed with primary emphasis on the visual system as a model for understanding structure/function relationships. The course will also introduce students to modern methodological approaches in systems neuroscience. A major goal of the course is to familiarize students with reading and critiquing primary research literature through weekly readings, small group discussions, and short written summaries of scientific papers."

The course develops the theory of dynamic models in decision and game theoretic environments, develops numerical methods for the computation of these models, and culminates with a thorough treatment of statistical estimation of dynamic models. The goal of the course is to equip graduate students with analytical, numerical, and statistical tools that can be used in their future research on applied topics, and specific applications will be considered at some length. Some familiarity with a programming language (such as Matlab or R) is a plus, but the dedicated student should be able to acquire basic programming skills needed for the course."

Do different fields such as philosophy, psychology, and biology share evidence and argumentative strategies? Is the meaning of evidence static across these fields? We will begin by investigating different models of argument from philosophy and argumentation theory, and then students will use these broad models to investigate and analyze argument in academic contexts of their choice. We will also explore how these theoretical accounts of argument apply to popular contexts such as advertising, public deliberation, and journalism.

Worldwide there is a resurgent interest in medical ecology to offer analytic paradigms to study, track, and address both new and old risks to human health, taking into account micro- and macro-environmental conditions and processes. Medical ecology is particularly concerned with applying a systems approach to analyzing disease, with an emphasis on how change in environments relates to change in risk of exposure and incidence of disease. Many methods are used to generate and test medical ecological models, drawn from medical geography, epidemiology, biology, and the social sciences. Many of the lessons from this course come from global health, health impact of colonial relationships, and diseases of lifestyle and modernization."

Students will leave the course with a deeper understanding of how rules and strategy shape U.S. democracy. No prior background in game theory is necessary for this course."

These two ethnic nationalities have developed unequally since the establishment of colonial Brazil by Portugal in the sixteenth century. The 2010 census shows the average income of Afro-Brazilians was less than half that of White Brazilians. In 2009, the wealth gap between White and Black American families was $236,500. The most populous African nation, Nigeria, shows similar inequality among its major ethnic nationalities. This magnitude of inequality among ethnic nationalities has given rise to serious problems in inter-group relations in the three countries. This course aims to trace, comparatively, the historical origins of the phenomenon, examine the political and economic consequences, and discuss the politics and economics of state policy designed to address it. *NOTE: Students taking this Course for ECO credit must have previously taken ECO 108*"

A great deal of literary history is the story of intricately rewriting and adapting the core texts of these traditions; it has been said that the European philosophical tradition is a series of footnotes to Plato. While doing justice to any one of these authors or traditions in a single semester would be a challenge, the goal of this class is to read as much as possible of the classical and scriptural tradition in the short time we have, giving you a solid introduction to some of the key stories and ideas that have generated so much thought, conflict, and human creativity over the past two dozen centuries.

We use case studies to examine how religion, politics and culture interact to create opportunities for positive or negative engagement across religious traditions. We study the etiquette of interreligious engagement in multi-religious contexts building skills for global citizenship. Students will be assigned to a community partner organization (e.g. Gandhi Institute, Hickey Center for Interfaith Studies and Dialogue) for hands-on interfaith projects and will attend and observe religious rituals in three world religious traditions."

Meanwhile, for legal and mental health professions, proof of guilt is used to sort the good from the bad, the normal from the deviant, and the socially respectable from the socially disposable. Not all is so dour, however. Guilt lives in confession, denunciation, and in criminal sentencing, but it is also the stuff of jokes, of ethnic pride, and of eroticism. Toward an anatomy of guilt, in this course we will draw on the works of Freud, Nietzsche, Arendt, Foucault, Janet Malcolm and Sarah Schulman, and we will wrestle with the films\u2014and complicated legacies\u2014of Alfred Hitchcock and Woody Allen, two filmmakers who are preoccupied with (and implicated by) guilt, as feeling and as fact."

These struggles largely revolved around some fundamental questions: Who is God? Who is Jesus Christ? What is scripture? What is Christianity? Who is Christian? How are Christians to act? While these questions were provisionally addressed in the earliest Christian writings, they were not resolved authoritatively until the 4th-6th centuries, when church leaders repeatedly gathered at councils to fix official church doctrine on various controversial issues (e.g. Jesus Christ, scripture, the Trinity, and original sin). This class will survey how, from the beginning (but especially after the 4th century), Christians tried to answer these questions in various ways (through theology, dialogue, debate, censure, excommunication, episcopal influence, and others) and thereby determined the subsequent course of Christianity."

Markings, Methods, and Materials can be viewed as an extension of any 100-level studio course and provides an opportunity to exercise and explore the techniques and cognitive processes that are utilized and applied in art production and adjacent fields of learning.

Through an analysis of representative works of fiction, essay, chronicle and poetry, we will examine the artistic and political implications of the movement, and we will discuss how Modernismo continues to inform contemporary cultural debates as well as notions of identity in the 21st century, as seen in street performances and graffiti.

This course will examine the values of health, social needs, and freedom through a systematic examination of situations in which these conflicts arise."

Even though you will be doing a lot of programming in this course, its purpose is not to teach you to become an expert in any particular language or framework. Web technologies change at a blistering pace, so specifics quickly get outdated. However, once you take this course and understand the fundamentals, you will be able to easily pick up new technologies on the fly. *No audits will be allowed for this course.

We will begin with an introduction to computer music and audio programming. After a quick review of C, we will use the PortSF library to generate and process basic envelopes and waveforms, and to explore the development of the table-lookup oscillator and other DSP tools. Max and Pure Data are similar visual programming languages for music and multimedia. We will use Max to explore topics in sound synthesis, signal processing, and sound analysis, as well as computer music. Python is a general-purpose programming language used in many application domains. We will use JythonMusic, a special version of Python, for music making, building graphical user interfaces, and for connecting external human interface devices. Students will practice their programming techniques through a series of programming assignments and a final project."

It will begin with a review of numerical errors and then develop simple algorithms for solving nonlinear algebraic and differential equations. The later half of the course will cover several analytical techniques useful for solving ordinary and partial differential equations encountered in various areas of optics and photonics. Students will be given weekly homework problems based on the material covered each week. Course Textbook: S. Chapra, Applied Numerical Methods with MATLAB, 3rd edition (McGraw-Hill, 2011)."

We examine representations of college, how each constructs its object, and how construction affects lived experience. We unpack race, class, and gender as reflecting and relating to identity formation in college. Our main object of analysis is the language used to describe college; we review the impact of descriptions as much as the experience itself.

So what do copy editors do? Is copyediting simply about enforcing rules of correctness? When is it okay to break those rules, or to allow others to do so, and what guides such decisions? How do copy editors understand and negotiate the relationships and interests of readers, writers, and the publications they work for? How has the information age changed the way copy editors think about and approach textual editing? In this class we will address both the principles and practices of copyediting.

      "description": "This course takes up translation process as an object of study. How do translators work? What opportunities and constraints are present for freelance, specialist, or professional translators? To what extent do translators not only transmit but actively create knowledge and build community via their work of interpreting and adapting? We\u2019ll explore a range of potentially high-stakes cases involving textual, audiovisual, and multimodal renditions of a source text. These may include translating an ad or museum label; subbing a TED Talk or performance; dubbing in anime or games; interpreting for business, medical, or other purposes. Along with course readings and short experimental translations, students will work with our paraprofessional consultants and community partners in SW Rochester to craft final projects that provide a meaningful extension of course learning to real-world issues (Counts toward the Citation in Community-Engaged Scholarship; see Authentically Urban, Virtually Global: Southwest Rochester)."

      "description": "Digital media students often publicly showcase their work while pursuing internships, careers, and postgraduate education. To prepare for this, students in this course will design interactive portfolios to showcase their work. Digital portfolios present unique challenges because, like much public work, they frequently engage multiple audiences that might have conflicting expectations. In this course students will explore their professional interests, identities, and goals in order to identify relevant audiences. Based on their audience and purpose, students will focus on making effective choices about platform, style, content, and design in order to create their own portfolios. Using self-reflection as well as peer and instructor feedback, students will revise and refine their work across the semester. Students will also be encouraged to seek external feedback from professionals in the field."

      "description": "In this course students will investigate the following questions: What is argument? What is evidence? To answer these questions, students will also think deeply about how context does or does not shape our understanding of these concepts. For instance, what do arguments in STEM fields have in common with those in the humanities? Do different fields such as philosophy, psychology, and biology share evidence and argumentative strategies? Is the meaning of evidence static across these fields? We will begin by investigating different models of argument from philosophy and argumentation theory, and then students will use these broad models to investigate and analyze argument in academic contexts of their choice. We will also explore how these theoretical accounts of argument apply to popular contexts such as advertising, public deliberation, and journalism. Students will explore these issues through reflective writing, several short papers and a research project of their own design."

Drawing on social and political concepts like community, power, justice, and democracy, and scholars who reflect on these issues, this course will engage with a variety of texts (scholarship, blogs, documentary films) as we consider how the political can inform what we believe and impact the choices we make as writers. Through experiential learning and reflective writing, students will explore the power of writing to elicit equity, inclusion, and change. Research projects may include traditional academic source material, primary research such as fieldwork, surveys, and interviews, and direct work with local community organizations. Class time will include visits from community speakers and off-campus events. This is a community-engaged course that meets the requirement for the citation in community-engaged scholarship."

In this class, students will explore their creative and professional identities through both reflection on their own work and rigorous research into relevant audiences whom they intend to engage. We will also go beyond individual identity to explore community identity and investigate the interplay of individuals and communities. This knowledge will be used to construct a digital portfolio that makes effective choices about platform, style, content, and design, based on their own goals and interests. Using self-reflection as well as peer and instructor feedback, students will revise and refine their work throughout the semester."
